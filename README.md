### FluMoDLpack version 0.1

FluMoDLpack is a set of R scripts that implements a standard set of analyses
of influenza-attributable mortality using FluMoDL. It relies on the 
[FluMoDL R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=FluMoDL) to do the 
actual model fitting and analysis.

The objective of FluMoDLpack is to facilitate the analyses and standardize the
output, so that EuroMOMO network members have a common frame of reference and 
can readily share information.

See the included manual (manual.html) for detailed usage information.
